# Umbraco Package Ideas

Open ideas for Umbraco community packages - **set your ideas free**!

This repository is here to provide a collaboration and discussion space for Umbraco package ideas.

### Give an idea?

If you have an idea for a potential Umbraco package and would like to share it the world, please do feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-package-ideas/issues). No problem if you don't have the coding skills, not enough hours in the day, or unsure where to start - by **sharing your idea** it will be open and available for the Umbraco community to collaborate on together.


### Take an idea?

If you do have coding skills but unsure what to develop? Please do [take an idea!](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-package-ideas/issues)

You can develop in collaboration or in isolation, it's all good - the implementation of any idea is a **big win** for the Umbraco community.

Once you claim an idea for implementation, I'll move the issue [over to a discussion](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-package-ideas/discussions) and that'll mark it as claimed and in-progress.
