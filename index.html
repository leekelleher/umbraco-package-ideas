			<h3>Set your ideas free!</h3>
			<p>Welcome to our community repository of <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-package-ideas/">Umbraco package ideas</a>!</p>
			<p>The concept behind this repository is to provide a better collaboration and discussion space for Umbraco package ideas.</p>
			<p>Having been involved with the Umbraco community since 2007, (ðŸ‘‹ <em>Hi, I'm 12xMVP Lee Kelleher!</em> ðŸ˜…), I started to develop various plugins and packages, I had many ideas, but never enough time to develop them all, so I kept a note of them in a text file. Around 2012, I made <a href="https://gist.github.com/leekelleher/3077519">some of the ideas public</a>. I continued to add ideas to the list up until about 2015, when I moved the ideas over to a <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-package-ideas/">GitHub repository</a>, with an intention to have a more fully featured website - although this didn't really happen. Turns out that I hadn't added any new ideas since 2017.</p>
			<p>Fast forward to 2022, it's <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> time, and the Umbraco community seems to have a renewed interest in Package Ideas. I decided to scrap the separate website idea, favouring to use GitHub features <em>(that weren't around in 2015)</em>, like discussions and project boards.</p>

			<h3>Give an idea?</h3>
			<p>If you have an idea for a potential Umbraco package and would like to share it the world, please do feel free to <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-package-ideas/issues">open an issue</a> on the GitHub repository. No problem if you don't have the coding skills, not enough hours in the day, or unsure where to start - by <strong>sharing your idea</strong> it will be open and available for the Umbraco community to collaborate on together.</p>
			
			<h3>Take an idea?</h3>
			<p>What if you have the coding skills but unsure what to develop... please do <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-package-ideas/issues">take an idea!</a> As long as you credit where the original idea came from, you are free to take the idea and run with it. Although collaboration will always be encouraged, choosing to go solo is totally fine, <em>(I often prefer to do most of my initial development work alone, then share later for validation and iteration)</em>. The execution of any idea is a <strong>big win</strong> for the Umbraco community!</p>
			<p>Once you claim an idea for implementation, I'll move the issue <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-package-ideas/discussions">over to a discussion</a> and that'll mark it as taken.</p>
